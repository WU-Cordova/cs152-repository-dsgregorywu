This is my Bearcat Bistro Project!
Some Data Structure choices I made:
- For menus, I used a series of lists and dictionaries with prices on them. I used these because it was a good way of being able to easily access and iterate through each menu while also having a designated price. A linkedlist might've been better for complexity since I'm not ever changing the size of these menus, but linkedlists don't interact as well with dictionaries.
- For Customer Orders, I made a class with a bunch of properties that vary between tracking what the customer wants in their order, to the price, to the customer name, and lots more. This was helpful because it let me treat each class as an object that I am able to access from wherever in my program. This was the only data structure that I felt would be good, as nothing else allows me to store as many variables within it.
- For the Orders Queue, I used a Deque. I chose this because it allowed me to track which orders came when. It was either this or the original Queue, and I figured I would rather have the option of adding things to the front of the queue (which I haven't implemented, but definitely could be useful in a "Rush Order" feature) than the ability to wrap around from the Circular Queue.
- For Completed Orders, I used another Deque for very similar reasons. What was frustrating about using the Deque was that they are not iterable, so I had to do a pretty large workaround for a few of my main functions, but it ended up working pretty well.
- For building drinks, I used a ListStack. This was incredibly useful, as it allowed me to add in a "Back" feature for my custom drink ordering. I could've used something like a circularqueue for this, but I thought that using a stack would allow me for better, quick access to what pages. It also is better for complexity!

- Running the program: Right now, you need to log in as an employee with a password (I only have myself lol). You are then prompted to a home screen, where you can view each section of the ginormous bistro menu, place a new order, view open orders, close an order, view daily reports, or exit the program. The navigation of this is pretty easy, type in whatever you are prompted to. When ordering drinks or snacks, you can use B for back, or Q to quit. 

- If I had more time to work on this, I would likely implement a Rush Order system, as well as time based automatic order preparation. I also would like to split this up into a few different files, but I tried and it didn't work. Hopefully by May this will be fixed!! I also would fix a bunch of formatting things, just to make the text read back more like a coffee shop. Unfortunately this is WAY more trouble than what its worth, so I'm just gonna let it be.

Here's the output of one run through the simulator!
